# Hi there, I'm Rayyan Ahmed ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm just starting my journey in the tech world, with a keen interest in **Cybersecurity and Information Technology**. I'm currently focused on learning and absorbing as much knowledge as I can in these fields. While I'm not working on any projects right now, I'm excited about the learning process and the opportunities to apply this knowledge in the future.

### Fun Fact
I once participated in a hackathon without any prior experience, and it turned out to be one of the most exhilarating learning experiences I've ever had. It sparked my interest in cybersecurity even further and showed me the importance of hands-on learning.

## Learning Journey
As I'm in the early stages of my career, I'm dedicating most of my time to learning. I'm exploring various aspects of cybersecurity and IT, from network security to ethical hacking, and everything in between. If you have any resources, courses, or advice that could help me on this journey, feel free to share!

## Let's Connect
I'm always looking to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and professionals. Whether you have questions, want to share knowledge, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to me.
